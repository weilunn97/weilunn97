I'm a **software engineer**. I'm also...

☑ A **passionate developer** who is constantly obsessed with providing the best possible experience to users, 

☑ A **thinker** who enjoys being challenged at work, and finally...

☑ A **person** who seeks meaning in everything I do!

I'm Wei Lun, a second-year dual-degree Nanyang Scholar at NTU, majoring in both Computer Science and Business Analytics.
